A tasty async [AngularJS]() Table directive.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the tasty-table repository

### Install Dependencies

For running the demo and test the directive you just need install
all the dependencies by `npm`, the [node package manager][npm]. 

```
npm install
```

### Run demo app

We have preconfigured the demo with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```


## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the angular-seed application: Unit tests and End to End tests.

### Running Unit Tests

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

### End to end testing

Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running
and WebDriver is updated, you can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:

```
npm run protractor
```
